# Progressive Web App Workshop

## Welcome!

Thank you for joining us in today's workshop. We will be learning about Progressive Web Apps including how to:

- Register a service worker
- Listen for and handle the service worker `install`, `activate`, `fetch`, `message`, `push` and `notificationclick` events
- Use the Cache and Fetch APIs with your service worker
- Handle a fetch event when the network is offline
- Create a cache to precache a list of required and optional assets
- Implement different caching strategies
- Set up a fallback image and offline page
- Handle different asset types to provide an appropriate caching strategy
- Version caches (including purging old caches)
- Write basic cache trimming logic
- Set up a manifest file
- Set up Add To Home Screen
- Set up a basic Push Notification

Thank you for giving us the opportunity to share with you. We are happy and excited to be here!
